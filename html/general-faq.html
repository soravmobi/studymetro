                                            in the Master's level. In the Bachelor's level students have to appear for that
                                            Sitting and Sitting subject tests. United Kingdom colleges require IELTS / TOEFL
                                            for admissions. All leading business schools around the globe require the GMAT
                                            for admissions (a number of them will accept the GRE too).</p>

                                        <p>A: USA and Canadian colleges need students to possess 16 many years of undergraduate
                                            education for admission, although a couple of colleges have waived this requirement
                                            now. It is best to pursue a minimum of one year of the Master's degree course
                                            and fulfill this requirement before you decide to apply (some schools might even
                                            require the second year from the Master's degree). United kingdom and European
                                            colleges, however, stick to the fifteen years of undergraduate study pattern
                                            which is comparable to the Indian system of your practice and therefore do not
                                            need a 16th year.</p>

                                        <h3>Q: What's the new GRE?</h3>
                                        <p>A: The brand new GRE offers to lessen the concentrate on vocabulary, getting rid
                                            of antonyms and analogies completely. Within the Verbal section, the main focus
                                            will change from vocabulary to reading through comprehension, and quantitative
                                            reasoning will concentrate on data interpretation and real existence situations.
                                            Overall, the brand new GRE is going to be such as the GMAT in lots of ways. Have
                                            minimum three several weeks of preparation here we are at the GRE. I recommend
                                            that you simply make reference to books for example The Official Help guide to
                                            GRE in addition to Barons Help guide to the brand new GRE. Nevertheless, with
                                            effective preparation you ought to be fine using the new GRE. A lot of the brand
                                            new GRE can be obtained at world wide web.gre.org. Each section within the new
                                            GRE is going to be obtained on the scale of 130-170, making 340 our prime score
                                            and 260 the reduced score.</p>

                                            well, you can find a job once you graduate. However, job prospects are more effective
