(1, '8 Ways Study Abroad Has Made it simpler for Me Grow', '1. I really like speaking to other people\r\nI obtained this skill on the Airplane to America. The relaxation of time abroad, I ongoing to speak to whoever looked interesting everyone were built with a fascinating journey, and was prepared to share. The moment they heard which i had a highlight, they instantly desired to learn more about me. Since I have been back, basically hear someone by having an accent, it''s far simpler for me personally now, to increase for them and request where are you currently from? Who knows who you are likely to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. I am a threat taker\r\nWhile being abroad, I had a why not and who cares attitude. You had think this attitude would only operate in an aspiration world, or vacation - but you had be amazed at just how advantageous it may be in the USA. I so frequently would enter into this tiresome schedule where every single day was exactly the same and absolutely nothing interesting happened. Basically take risks, nevertheless tiny as using for income I am not qualified for, or using the lengthy way home, simply because it is more beautiful, existence soon becomes much more interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Nice Opportunities on my career\r\nAfter adding my study abroad experience to my resume, I have become a lot of oos and aahs. For me, this really is always among the first things future companies request about - how had been abroad? Despite the fact that all of us known this really is this type of challenging question, be ready to answer! Think about what abilities you have learned abroad for you to discuss inside your resume cover letter or interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. I urged others to visit abroad\r\nI have inspired a lot of other students to use not just in my abroad college, but to review abroad programs generally. When other student takes a look at my abroad photos, they frequently say: wow - that is the most amazing place on the planet. Inches My fact is: the photos dont get it done justice, go discover for yourself. Inches all joking aside, perhaps you have seen my pictures? The greater you rave regarding your experience, the greater you motivate others look around the world and every one of its amazing cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. I am enthusiastic\r\nWhile abroad I observed others actions and values, and found the final outcome that lots of people only do things they love. They study the things they love, volunteer where they think connected, and make an application for jobs that they are enthusiastic about. Within my encounters in the USA, lots of people do extracurricular activities simply because they will appear good on the resume. I have learned to prevent attempting to impress individuals with a 5 page resume, and merely do what I enjoy do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. I live in the Present\r\nForget exactly what the future holds, discover the beauty now. It appears just like a moment ago I had been climbing the Sydney Harbor Bridge, and today I am relaxing in the class. While abroad, I loved each and every moment and try to require another to savor the wonder that we was encircled with. Why must this stop simply because I am home?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. I appreciate everything \r\nSince I have turn into back, I see my minute problems to be minor in comparison to problems within the relaxation around the globe. Should you be studying inside a under developed country, like other student did, surely you had have a more powerful appreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. World Exposure \r\nIt is vital that you understand how other areas on the world work, instead of believing that every country operates exactly the same way as America. Studying within the southern hemisphere, the semesters were different, classes were run in a different way, and also the weather was different, amongst other things. I learnt concerning the Australian media and government, that is far diverse from the united states media and government, and that i are now able to consider myself global minded because I have observed, analyzed, therefore becoming informed.

Some countries use different TV systems (remember this when buying videos and DVDs internationally). And, unfortunately, most countries use a different type of cell phone service, too.\r\n\r\nEurope and much of the world adopted a common world phone standard called Global Service for Mobile (GSM). Equally important, Europe, Africa and Asia not only had the foresight to adopt the same cell phone standard, but they also decided that their cell phone networks would operate on the same frequencies (the 900mhz, initially and later the 1800mhz band). This explains why the same cell phone that works in London will work equally well in Johannesburg, Beijing and Sydney.\r\n\r\nMost countries around the globe - more than 205 at last count - have adopted the GSM wireless technology and if you plan on studying overseas, outside of North America and want the convenience of carrying a travel phone, then you''re going to need a GSM international cell phone.\r\n\r\nThe United States did not standardize and consequently competing wireless standards emerged from the various wireless carriers. Just so you know the names, in the US our cell phone service is most likely to be the CDMA type (Verizon and Sprint), or perhaps TDMA or even iDEN (Nextel) or AMPS (you don''t want to know what these acronyms stand for and fortunately you don''t need to know).\r\n\r\nWhile there are some North American GSM cellular providers (T-Mobile and Cingular), they unfortunately operate on a different (1900mhz) frequency than is used abroad, however there are some multi-band world phones now available through these US carriers. The "international roaming" rate for this service can be measured in dollars per minute though you will be accessible on your US number while overseas.\r\n\r\nA GSM worldwide mobile phone could be leased for typically $29-$59/week with each minute charges varying from $1.50-$5/minute, for the incoming and outgoing calls. Should you travel rarely (less then once/ year) as well as your stay is less a week this might be the best choice despite the crazy each minute costs. Though most study abroad programs lasting 1-3 several weeks you''d need another student load to merely repay your phone bill.\r\n\r\nTo actually make the most of a mobile phone overseas and never require a second mortgage in your house, you will need to get your own GSM worldwide mobile phone along with a prepaid Sim for your forthcoming worldwide destination. Normally, this is the best choice for college students studying overseas. Unlike typical mobile phones in America, GSM world mobile phones don''t include telephone numbers designed into them and also the actual services are not really associated with the telephone itself. Rather clients activate their cell phones by popping in so-known as Sims, little thumbnail sized products that determine your mobile phone number and then any additional services like voicemail message.\r\n\r\nCountry-Specific Sims\r\nA pre-compensated Sim for every country you visit (an Italia Sim, France Sim, The country Sim Australia Sim), provides you with a nearby telephone number and native calling rates are generally a low 25 cents/minute. It is simple, convenient, and comparatively affordable that you should call others in the united states you are going to, and simple and normal to allow them to call to for your local number, too. On top of that, Incoming calls have the freedom no matter where they originate. You are able to replenish your airtime around the Sim by buying an airtime voucher within the local currency variations. They are offered for the most part newsstands, kiosks and supermarkets. The airtime vouchers are scratch cards which have a pin code that you simply simply key to your phone for fast credit.\r\n\r\nWorldwide Sims\r\nIf you are visiting numerous nations on one trip, you will find also choices to remove the requirement for another Sim in every country you visit. A Worldwide or Worldwide pre-compensated Sim usually has a United kingdom ( 44) number and enables cheaper roaming across Europe and far from the GSM world for reduced than your US company could allow.\r\n\r\nThese Global Sims will also be usually less expensive when roaming through other nations than a local European country SIM allows. For instance, you might buy a pre-compensated Sim for Italia, and receive excellent local rates while for the reason that country, but visit France or The country and that is when you will be hit by Worldwide roaming charges. A pre-compensated Sim purpose designed for such country-hopping travel frequently also receives as standard free incoming minutes. Topping your calling minutes usually can be achieved with the provider''s customer support, online or via a phone recharge menu.\r\n\r\nIf worldwide calling and Sim technologies are a new comer to you, check the supply of reaching customer support. Some companies offer standard US business hrs assistance, which might not mean much for you when you are on European or Asian time. A 24-hour Customer Support department won''t ever make you in need of assistance on a trip abroad. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, having a prepaid mobile phone you''ve got a economical method of remaining in contact with no bills, no roaming charges with no extra problems.', '2016-11-25 14:00:44');

The wide range of study fields offered in foreign universities includes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;a href=&quot;http://studymetro.com&quot;&gt;Studying Abroad&quot;&lt;/a&gt; has always been allured the aspiring students who actually want to give their career a radical move. Such decision not only opens thousands avenues for higher education but makes an individual capable of facing and resolving the global issues; builds a lifetime commitment to the self-esteem, self-determination and social values. However, the main benefits of studying abroad can be summarized as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Growth: Students learn a lot more about themselves in that one semester than they did in the three and a half years in their home school because of the unique space in which they learn experience and spend exploring another culture. Study abroad leads to long-lasting friendships with other students and impacts current relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Develop skills and gain experience a classroom setting will never provide: Being immersed in an entirely new cultural setting is exciting. It&#39;s an opportunity to discover new strengths and abilities, conquer new challenges, and solve new problems. You will encounter situations that are wholly unfamiliar to you and will learn to adapt and respond in effective ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The opportunity to break out of your academic routine: You can become familiar with an entirely new academic system and you will have the chance to take courses not offered on your home campus. It&#39;s also a great opportunity to break out the monotony of the routine you follow semester after semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Expand your worldview: Students normally tend to be uninformed about the world beyond the nation&#39;s boundaries. Students who study abroad return home with an informed and much less biased perspective toward other cultures and peoples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Enhance the value of your degree: While abroad, you can take courses you would never have had the opportunity to take on your home campus. In addition, study abroad gives your language skills such a boost that it is normally quite easy to add a minor in a language or even a second major without having to take many more additional courses after the return to your home campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Learn about yourself: The experience abroad often challenges students to reconsider their own beliefs and values. The experience may perhaps strengthen those values or it may cause students to alter or abandon them and embrace new concepts and perceptions. The encounter with other cultures enables students to see their own culture through new eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Enhance employment opportunities: Through an employer&#39;s eyes, a student who has studied abroad is self-motivated, independent, willing to embrace challenges, and able to cope with diverse problems and situations. Your experience living and studying in a foreign country, adjusting to another culture, and acquiring a foreign language will all set you apart from the majority of other job applicants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. A Lifetime of benefits: With study abroad offering so many life-changing and enduring academic, career, intercultural, personal, and social benefits, students should carefully consider studying abroad when searching for a college/ university. In addition, colleges, parents, and employers should encourage and enable students to study abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Education and career attainment: When questioned about academic pursuits, 87 percent of respondents said that study abroad influenced subsequent educational experiences, 63 percent said that it influenced their decision to expand or change academic majors, and 64 percent reported that it influenced their decision to attend graduate school. Nearly half of all respondents have engaged in international work or volunteerism since studying abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Longer stay - greater benefits: Conventional wisdom in the study abroad field has been that &quot;more is better&quot;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the longer students study abroad, the more significant the academic and cultural development and personal growth benefits. Students will be successful in producing important academic, inter- and intra-personal, career, and intercultural development outcomes.</p>\r\n', 13, 'Study Abroad', 'Study Abroad', 'Study Abroad', 1, '2016-10-26 15:18:32', 0, 'singapore_abroad2.jpg', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

As much as I always aspired to study abroad, I was unaware of the process to do so. Hence, I needed professional assistance. Initially I was a little nervous as most people''s feedback on consultancies aren''t too positive. But Study Metro proved that wrong, they helped me throughout the process from shortlisting the university to all the way until my visa interview. The best part is that they paid attention to every little detail, from helping me prepare for my visa interview to the arrangement of the documents as required. Not only did they make the experience hassle free but also boosted my confidence to get through it. Nishi, Zaid and Abbie in particular been incredibly supportive and have helped me throughout the process, they were always glad to help even at odd hours when I was stuck with my something.

Before this I consulted many agents of my own city and even I wasted a lot of time and money but I did not got any positive outcome. I was completely fed up from all this and then I searched for US consultants...and I got the name of study metro.. I called them and got the complete information about US visa processing and about the known universities.....at the initial stage it was really very hard to trust a person who is sitting far away from me and even i dont know anything about him...but slowly I convinced myself and it is the result of this trust that I am having a US visa in my hand and very soon I will fly to US.\r\n\r\none thing that i would like to appreciate about study metro is that it has a very helping staff and they are always present to help us whenever we need ...not only the staff even the head is very kind and motivating...he gave me proper visa interview training and he motivated me alot to get the visa.\r\n\r\nI would like to say everyone that this is the right time to consult study metro and make your future bright.', 'Rimal ', 0, '2016-10-25 04:53:29'),

In today‚Äôs world it true that we can find the college and other education related information from the web but still at some point we want someone who can hold our hand and help us to achieve our dream. Study Metro is one of that hand who helped me in this journey. I met Mr. Zaid in September 2014 in Study Metro‚Äôs Bangalore office. From my experience with Study MetroI can say that STUDY METRO is very professional and the way they guided me in selecting my education institute and documentation process was just so simple. At every point of time Mr. Zaid and STUDY METRO showed their full integrity towards my case. I also want to thanks Mr. Abbie for his US visa interview tips which he gave me before my visa interview. That mock visa interview was a perfect shot in my US visa interview process. That not only gave me an idea about the interview questions but more importantly it boosted my confidence level. I will recommend STUDY METRO that they should conduct this mock visa interview for students before real visa interview because during real visa interview a interviewer has only 4 to 5 minutes to judge a student‚Äôs credibility.

I have been working in the US Healthcare Industry since 2010 and had a zeal to do my MBA in Healthcare Management in US and work there in US. I met STUDY METRO president Mr. Fred online when i was browsing the STUDY METRO site in 2011. Fred asked for my number and we had a conversation about my plans and interest. Fred gave me the complete information about the programs available with the option of full time work. I then decided to apply and started my application process the immediate day. After i got my I20 i was introduced to Abbie who was gave me a good help guiding me through the visa interview etc. STUDY METRO also provides the Visa training which is also one of the best service given. My visa was rejected thrice in HYD and i almost lost hopes on my dreams and plans. ??In the year 2013 April there was a meet at Hyderabad which was kinda seminar given by Coleman President Paul, STUDY METRO Fred and VP Abbie. At that time i was informed by Abbie to meet and attend the seminar. I went there however i dint have any hopes on this program and was searching for alternatives. When i met Fred, Paul and Abbie they boosted me to apply again and encouraged me not to be dis hearted and advised me to try for visa again. Though i accepted was thinking again if i should apply or no. Then i felt that let me give a try and may be this time it would work and gained courage and started my application process again while i was working for the current organization Genpact. This time Carol was the visa trainer and also took my visa mock interview then followed by tips etc. ??The day finally arrived when i had to travel to Chennai for the Visa interview. I was completely tensed and i reached the Visa Consulate Chennai @ 7:30 AM i was waiting for my turn and hid all my tension and was with a cool mind. I was with a smiling face which was covering all my tension. This time it was a great interview where the Visa officer was looking at the DS-160 for my profile and asked me limited questions which was related to my work and my future plans in MBA - Healthcare Management. Then came the magical words for which i was waiting for 3Yrs " Have a Safe Journey to US". I was overwhelmed and was damn happy, i rushed back to hotel called my parents, friends etc. It was really a great pleasure meeting STUDY METRO which made my dream come true, I seriously admit that if i had missed the seminar where i met the STUDY METRO Management and the Coleman President it would have happened. I Sincerely and hole heartedly thank STUDY METRO which gave me an opportunity to make my dreams come true.??Thank You STUDY METRO.??All the Best to the future applicants.', 'Naveen Raj', 0, '2016-10-25 05:08:04'),

He arrived back in New South Wales at the age of twenty in 1815 the year that most people would declare was the beginning of his   ‚Äòlifetime of achievements.‚Äô\n\nWentworth was a landowner and sheep grazier who had an adventurous spirit and a desire to discover new pastures; this led him at the young age of twenty three in 1818 to undertake the first inland exploration in New South Wales, the crossing over the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. He completed the difficult but successful exploration alongside his fellow explorers Gregory Blaxland and William Lawson.\n\nWentworth returned to England in 1822 and studied at Cambridge University,  studied law and became a Barrister. In the years 1824-1827 he became involved in politics and became a political activist. He wrote a book, which had a big impact on migration in Australia; it referred to the subject of immigration and ‚Äòwhy people should come to live in Australia, rather than America‚Äô. In the same year he argued for freedom of the press and founded Australia''s first newspaper called ‚ÄòThe Australian''. He remained co-owner of the Australian from 1824 until 1827.', 'William Charles Wentworth also played a major part in the Australian political system. He was 64 when he moved to have changes made to the Constitution Bill and this contributed to Australia having responsible government. He also argued for trial by jury and a formal process of appeal, which were laws that hadn‚Äôt previously existed in the Australian penal system.\n\nWilliam Charles Wentworth not only played a huge part in the political landscape of Australia but also became involved in Education. Between the years (1848-1854) he reformed education in New South Wales, he established primary school education in NSW, and most importantly he established the first Colonial University in the British Empire in 1848-49.\n\n \n\nWentworth had a full and adventurous life, he changed lives as well as influencing laws, politics and notably the educational systems in Australia. We hope our students can learn from William Charles Wentworth‚Äôs creativity, adventure, bravery, commitment to education and the pursuit of excellence. We hope that they will fully participate in the quality education that the Wentworth Institute has to offer.', NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

This exam costs approximately $32.00, does not require any preparation, and takes approximately 2 hours to complete. A link and password to access the exam will be provided once the admission application has been processed. ?Students who attain a satisfactory score can then proceed with their MBA degree with no additional preparatory or prerequisite coursework needed.\n?Students who do not meet the minimum score established by the department on the Inbound Peregrine Exam will be required to take the Academic Leveling Course (ALC) through Peregrine Academic Services. The ALC course is comprised of fifteen modules and must be completed prior to enrollment of the next course. MBA students who do not successfully complete the ALC modules by the end of the first course(s) are converted to a non-degree seeking status. This self-paced course is designed to be a primer for the returning business major who has been out of school for a period of time. \n', 'Private', '$10,000', 'Master of Arts in Education (MAE)\nClinical Mental Health Counseling - partially online\nHistory - fully online\nScience and Mathematics\nScience - partially online\nMathematics - fully online\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA) - fully online\nMaster of Education (ME)\nCurriculum and Instruction - fully online\nGeneral Education (elementary)\nCareer and Technical Education (secondary)\nEducation Technology (elementary and secondary)\nMathematics (elementary and secondary)\nPhysical Education (elementary and secondary)\nReading Specialist PK-12\nSocial Science (elementary and secondary)\nSpecial Education K-12\nBusiness Education (secondary)\nCurriculum and Instruction - partially online\nLanguage Arts (elementary)\nScience (elementary and secondary)\nEducational Administration - fully online\nPrincipalship - Elementary, Secondary, Middle School or PK-12\nSpecial Education Supervisor Birth-12th grade\nCurriculum/Assessment Supervisor PK-12\nSchool Counseling - partially online\nMaster of Science in Organizational Management (MSOM)\nHuman Services - fully online\nSports Management - fully online\nNatural Resources - partially online', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'On Campus/Off Campus', '1 308-432-6000', 'admission@studymetro.com', NULL, '$50', NULL, 'Spring / Summer / Fall', 'http://www.csc.edu/', 'https://www.facebook.com/chadronstatecollege/', 'https://twitter.com/chadronstate', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'https://www.youtube.com/user/chadronstatecollege', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/chadronstatecollege', '[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]', NULL, 'CHADRON STATE COLLEGE', '\nChadron State College is located in Charon, Nebraska, has a population of approximately 6,000 residents.

They learn to write and direct plays, build robots, help cardiac patients with nutrition, improve nanotechnology, and more. Students have the opportunity to join a Learning Village that will offer smaller, caring groups led by faculty within the larger community. TTU is the first public university in the state to offer these communities in which a student can become a lifetime member.\n\nA Beautiful Place to Call Home\nLocated in Cookeville, Tennessee, a town of about 25,000 residents, TTU offers the best of both rural and urban living.
